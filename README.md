# Simple web3 game
Simple game developed in web3

## webapp
The frontend for the game using Phaser.js, metamask (todo), and web3.js (todo)

Just run `npm http-server ./webapp` and open `http://localhost:8080`

## solidity
The contracts for the whole shit. WAGMI. It's using truffle.

`truffle compile` and `truffle development` are probably your friends, but I don't know how to use truffle.
