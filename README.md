Simple game developed in web3

BSC Testnet GameToken address: `0xE57B8133ef5Fb98001e473bAa51DF0bca77cCF53`

You can find the game here [https://okano.dev/ethereum-game-testing/](https://okano.dev/ethereum-game-testing/)

## webapp
The frontend for the game using Phaser.js, metamask (todo), and web3.js (todo)

Just run `npm http-server ./webapp` and open `http://localhost:8080`

## solidity
The contracts for the whole shit. WAGMI. It's using truffle.

`truffle compile` and `truffle development` are probably your friends, but I don't know how to use truffle.
